# Fast-BVH-Octree-Bench
Fast multithreaded BVH and Octree (dynamic forced cubes) generation in plain JS, ~10ms for 10,000 entities with leaf indexing for traversal!

Improvements would come in the form of SharedArrayBuffers (requires hosted context) or fully offloading to a compute shader (tough as nuts!)
